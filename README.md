# SDE Manuscript Review Queue

A queue for two-stage peer review of stochastic differential equation manuscripts and their matching Jupyter notebooks.

## How to use it

Each manuscript is tracked as a **GitHub Issue**. Reviewers self-select work by commenting slash commands on issues:

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/checkout` | Claim a queued item for review |
| `/release`  | Hand it back to the queue |
| `/approve`  | (Second reviewer) finalize the review |

A manuscript moves through these stages automatically:

```
queued  →  review-1-active  →  awaiting-review-2  →  review-2-active  →  complete
```

The second reviewer must be a different person than the first — this is enforced automatically. When a review is approved, the package is zipped and emailed to the designated recipient, and the issue closes.

**Reviewers:** see [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full walkthrough of doing a first or second review.

**New to the repository?** See [`docs/LOCAL_SETUP_GUIDE.md`](docs/LOCAL_SETUP_GUIDE.md) for step-by-step instructions on cloning the repo, setting up your environment, and working with VS Code (with or without GitHub Copilot).

**To add a manuscript to the queue:** open a new issue using the *"Add manuscript to review queue"* template.
